### 1. **/data**
- **Purpose**: To manage all datasets used in the project.
- **Subfolders**:
  - **/raw**: Contains original, unprocessed datasets. This is where you store data as it is collected, without any modifications.
  - **/processed**: Contains cleaned and transformed datasets that are ready for analysis or modeling. This is where you save data after preprocessing steps like cleaning, normalization, or feature extraction.
  - **/external**: Stores any external datasets or APIs that you might use in your project. This could include third-party data sources or datasets from other projects.

### 2. **/notebooks**
- **Purpose**: To hold Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and prototyping.
- **Contents**: You can create notebooks to visualize data, perform statistical analysis, and experiment with different modeling techniques. Notebooks are great for documenting your thought process and sharing insights.

### 3. **/src**
- **Purpose**: To contain the main source code for the project.
- **Subfolders**:
  - **/models**: Contains scripts for training and evaluating machine learning models. This is where you implement your model training logic and save trained models.
  - **/features**: Holds scripts for feature engineering, where you create new features or modify existing ones to improve model performance.
  - **/visualization**: Contains scripts for visualizing data and model results. This is where you create plots and charts to help interpret your findings.
  - **/api**: Contains code for any APIs you might build to serve your model predictions. This is where you set up endpoints for making predictions based on user input.
  - **/utils**: A place for utility functions and helper scripts that can be reused across different parts of the project. This can include functions for data loading, logging, or any other common tasks.

### 4. **/tests**
- **Purpose**: To hold unit tests and integration tests for your code.
- **Contents**: You can create test scripts to ensure that your functions and models work as expected. This is crucial for maintaining code quality and catching bugs early in the development process.

### 5. **/docs**
- **Purpose**: To provide documentation for the project.
- **Contents**: This folder can include data dictionaries, model descriptions, and any other relevant documentation that helps explain the projectâ€™s structure, functionality, and usage.

### 6. **/virtual-preview**
- **Purpose**: To contain components related to the virtual preview feature of your application.
- **Subfolders**:
  - **/components**: Contains UI components (e.g., React components) for the virtual preview feature. This is where you build the interactive elements of your application.
  - **/assets**: Stores images, icons, and other media files used in the virtual preview.
  - **/styles**: Contains CSS or styling files for the virtual preview, allowing you to manage the visual appearance of your components.

### 7. **requirements.txt**
- **Purpose**: To list all the dependencies required for your project.
- **Contents**: This file should include all the libraries and packages your project needs to run, making it easy for others to set up the environment.

### 8. **README.md**
- **Purpose**: To provide an overview of the project.
- **Contents**: This file should include a project description, setup instructions, usage guidelines, and any other relevant information that helps users and contributors understand the project.

### Summary
This folder structure is designed to promote organization, scalability, and collaboration in your location predictor project. Each folder serves a specific purpose, making it easier to manage different aspects of the project and ensuring that your code and data are well-structured.
